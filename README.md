# AnDA_SPEEDY
Analog data assimilation for model selection using SPEEDY model data

This code collection is the base for the experiments described in Ailliot et al. 2022. 

To run a simple test performing Analog Data Assimilation with the SPEEDY model data, run the script /AnDA_SPEEDY/python/scripts/main_test_AnDA_SPEEDY.py . This scripts performs AnDA with a small sample of SPEEDY model data and produces a figure showing the time series of the true, the observations and the resulting analyisis for mid-level temperature at a single model grid point.
